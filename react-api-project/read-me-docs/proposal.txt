## Proposal

You must submit a proposal and have it passed by an instructor.
 This proposal is meant to help focus and scale your idea into a realistic MVP, 
 or minimum viable product, within a reasonable time frame.

Your proposal must contain the following:

1. Paragraph describing your app idea. What are you building? Who is it for?

2.  An easily describable [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).
    Remember you have a limited amount of time to develop this project. 
    What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and
    get a product in someone's hand?

3. [User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories).
 What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the time they hit the landing page? 
 What features do they need and which are optional?

4. [Wireframe](https://uxmastery.com/wireframing-for-beginners/). 
What is each page going to look like? What will be the layout, color scheme, etc? 
Check out [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) for a simple and free wireframing tool.

5. [Mind Map](https://www.mindmup.com/). 
What is the folder structure of your frontend app going to look like?
Make a diagram representing its component hierarchy.

Once you have these items, you need to post the proposal in the Level 4 channel 
and an instructor will give you the go ahead!

Use the proper pattern for user stories

1. This  App will display information on movies based on genre, (total number of genres TBD).
    Intended for general movie information. How many times have you argued with someone about the 
    release date, genre, or actors pertaining to a specific movie? 
    This App is intended to squash those debates! And in general be a cool way to browse movies.

2.  basic display will be Movie poster or cover, name of movie and summary at minimum.
    May include additional details based on time constraints, additional detail may be,
    realease date, actors, etc.

3. What brings a user to the App?
    Template: As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
    
    As a movie goer/patron, I want to be able to easily find information on Movies so that
    I can answer those nagging questions about details that I can't remember.

    As movie goer/patron, I want to be able to find movies I didn't even know existed so that
    I can find fresh/new entertainment. (if I havn't seen it, it's new to me!)

4. App will have a easily accessible theme button, initial theme will be rich in color, 
    colors will be based on the movie theater experience. (will be researched).
    second theme will ge an easy to read, not too colorful scheme for those with poor eyesight,
    or sensitive eyes.

5. Diagram:

            >footer/persists page refresh       > Attribution, Theme change Button
